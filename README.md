## Disclaimer

Hey, this is my second attempt with React Native (The first one is [here](https://github.com/jouderianjr/giphyStickers)), so I my still learning and improving my react skills (I'm a beginner), feel free to give me some feedbacks :heart:

## Next Steps

- Add Tests :sweat_smile:
- Show a loading indicator when the Gif is loading :alien:
- Fix minor issues.
